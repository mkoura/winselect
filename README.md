winselect
=========

Using dmenu display list of windows managed by the window manager and switch to the selected window.

You'll need to have "dmenu" (in the "suckless-tools" package on Debian) and "wmctrl" installed.

Should work with any window manager where dmenu and wmctrl works.

Can be used for quickly filtering through loads of open windows (e.g. terminal windows, rdesktop windows, etc.).
